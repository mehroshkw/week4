Flutter animation project

This project is a simple demonstration of using both implicit and explicit animation in Flutter. In this project, we have also used Rive for creating explicit animation.

Project Description
The project contains a simple interface with two buttons, each triggering a different animation. The first button triggers an implicit animation, which animates the container's color, size, and border radius properties. The second button triggers an explicit animation created using Rive, which animates an SVG image of a bouncing ball.


Dependencies
The following dependencies were used in this project:

rive: ^0.10.3 for creating explicit animations with Rive.
flutter_animate: ^4.1.0 creating explicit animations
